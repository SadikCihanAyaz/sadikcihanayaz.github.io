### âœ… Question 1: Return Emails of Verified Users

You have an array of user objects. Each user has an `email` and a boolean `isVerified` property.  
Return a new array containing only the emails of users who are verified.

const users = [
  { email: "alice@example.com", isVerified: true },
  { email: "bob@example.com", isVerified: false },
  { email: "charlie@example.com", isVerified: true }
];  
```
- Result: ["alice@example.com", "charlie@example.com"]

```ts
const getVerifiedEmails = (users) => {
  // Your code here
}
```

You have an array of product objects, each with a `name` and `price`.  
Return the name of the first product with a price less than 20. If there is none, return `null`.

const products = [
  { name: "Book", price: 25 },
  { name: "Pen", price: 5 },
  { name: "Notebook", price: 15 }
];  
Result: "Pen"

```ts
