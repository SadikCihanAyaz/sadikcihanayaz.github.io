# Interview Questions: Modules, ESM Imports/Exports, and Tooling (Metro, Webpack) in React Native TypeScript

This document provides detailed interview questions and answers focused on JavaScript module systems, bundling, Metro and Webpack in a React Native TypeScript context.

---

## Question 1: What is ESM (ECMAScript Modules), and how is it different from CommonJS?

**Answer:**  
ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is the standardized JavaScript module system introduced in ES6. It uses `import` and `export` statements to organize code into reusable modules. Unlike CommonJS (used in Node.js), which uses `require()` and `module.exports`, ESM supports static analysis, tree-shaking, and native browser support.

## Question 2: How do you use named and default exports in a React Native TypeScript file?

**Answer:**

```tsx
// utils/math.ts
export const add = (a : number , b : number) : number => a + b ;
export const subtract = (a : number , b : number) : number => a - b ;
export default function multiply( a : number , b : number ) : number {
    return a * b ;
}
```

```tsx
// usage.ts
import multiply , { add , subtract } from './utils/math' ;

const result = multiply( 3 , 4 ) ;
```

## Question 3: What is Metro bundler in React Native and how does it work?

**Answer:**  
**Metro** is the default JavaScript bundler used by React Native. A **bundler** is a tool that takes all your project files (JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, images, styles) and combines them into one or more optimized files ‚Äî called **bundles** ‚Äî that can be loaded by the app.

### üîß What does Metro actually do?

- **Parses and analyzes** your source code (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`) to determine all dependencies.
- **Transforms** the code using Babel:  
  - Transforms **TypeScript to JavaScript**  
  - Converts **JSX to JavaScript function calls**  
  - Adds **polyfills** and compatibility fixes
- **Minifies** and **optimizes** the output:  
  - Removes dead code (tree-shaking if possible)  
  - Compresses the code for performance
- **Serves the bundle** to the React Native runtime (on emulator or real device)

### üß† Example:

You write:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return <Text>Hello World</Text> ;
} ;
```

Metro transforms this into a JavaScript bundle that looks something like:

```js
const App = function() {
  return React.createElement(Text, null, 'Hello World') ;
} ;
```

Metro also watches file changes and supports **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**, allowing instant feedback during development.

## Question 4: Can you use Webpack with React Native? How is it different from Metro?

**Answer:**  
By default, **React Native uses Metro** because it is fast, lightweight, and specifically optimized for mobile bundling. However, **Webpack** can be used in special cases ‚Äî such as targeting **web** via `react-native-web`, or custom build pipelines.

### üîß What is Webpack?

Webpack is a general-purpose module bundler for JavaScript applications. It can bundle JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and even WASM. It's used widely in React for web apps.

### üÜö Metro vs. Webpack

| Feature           | Metro                            | Webpack                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Default in RN     | ‚úÖ Yes                           | ‚ùå No (manual config required)      |
| Targets           | Mobile (iOS, Android)            | Web                                 |
| Code splitting    | ‚ùå Limited                        | ‚úÖ Full control                     |
| Plugin ecosystem  | Minimal                          | Rich ecosystem                     |
| Config complexity | Easy (zero-config in RN)         | Customizable, but complex          |
| Use with TS       | ‚úÖ Uses Babel + TypeScript        | ‚úÖ Uses Babel + ts-loader or swc    |

### üß† When would you use Webpack?

- You're using `react-native-web` to run RN code in a browser
- You need advanced features like:
  - Code splitting
  - Asset hashing
  - Custom loader chains (e.g., for GraphQL, Markdown, etc.)
- You want to integrate with a larger web build system (Next.js, CRA, etc.)

## Question 5: How do you resolve TypeScript path aliases in a React Native project?

**Answer:**

1. In `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Install babel plugin:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
```

3. Update `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    ['module-resolver', {
      root: ['./src'],
      alias: {
        '@components': './src/components',
        '@utils': './src/utils'
      }
    }]
  ]
};
```

## Question 6: What is tree-shaking and how does it relate to ESM?

**Answer:**  
**Tree-shaking** is a process where unused code is removed from the final bundle. It‚Äôs effective when using **ESM**, because ESM allows static analysis of what‚Äôs imported/exported.

---

## Question 7: How do dynamic imports work in ESM?

**Answer:**

```tsx
const module = await import('./heavyComponent') ;
const HeavyComponent = module.default ;
```

Used for lazy-loading parts of your app to improve performance and reduce initial bundle size.

## Summary

- **Bundlers** like Metro and Webpack package code for runtime environments
- Metro is **optimized for mobile development**, Webpack is better for **web use cases**
- **Transforming** code means converting JSX/TS ‚Üí plain JavaScript
- Use **ESM and static imports** for performance and tree-shaking
- Webpack offers more flexibility, but Metro is simpler and faster for native apps

Understanding these tools is essential for building optimized and scalable React Native apps.
