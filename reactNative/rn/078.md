# End-to-End (E2E) Testing in React Native with Detox and Appium

End-to-End (E2E) testing plays a vital role in validating your entire app’s behavior, from the user interface down to the native logic. In React Native development, **Detox** and **Appium** are two of the most popular tools for automated E2E testing.

This article covers the differences between them and provides working examples for each, using React Native with TypeScript.

## Why E2E Testing?

- Simulates real user behavior across the full app
- Detects integration issues between components and services
- Useful for catching bugs in navigation, animations, and native modules

## Detox Overview

**Detox** is a gray-box E2E testing tool tailored for React Native. It runs tests directly inside the app process, making it fast and stable for CI environments.

### Features:

- Synchronizes automatically with the UI
- Provides native control of lifecycle events
- Supports iOS and Android
- Integrated into Metro/Gradle/Xcode toolchains

### Installation:

```bash
npm install --save-dev detox detox-cli jest-circus
npm install --save-dev @types/jest
```

Update your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "detox": {
    "configurations": {
      "ios.sim.debug": {
        "type": "ios.simulator",
        "device": {
          "type": "iPhone 14"
        },
        "binaryPath": "ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/YourApp.app"
      }
    },
    "testRunner": "jest"
  }
}
```

### Example Test:

```ts
// e2e/firstTest.e2e.ts

describe('Login Screen', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await device.launchApp();
  });

  it('should display the login form', async () => {
    await expect(element(by.id('login-form'))).toBeVisible();
  });

  it('should log in with valid credentials', async () => {
    await element(by.id('email-input')).typeText('user@example.com');
    await element(by.id('password-input')).typeText('password123');
    await element(by.id('login-button')).tap();

    await expect(element(by.text('Welcome'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Run the Test:

```bash
npx detox build --configuration ios.sim.debug
npx detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug
```

## Appium Overview

**Appium** is a versatile black-box automation tool for mobile and web apps. It simulates user interaction through the UI using the WebDriver protocol.

### Features:

- Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web)
- Works outside React Native (great for native modules)
- Integrates with Selenium ecosystem
- Supports many languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.)

### Installation (JS + WebDriverIO):

```bash
npm install --save-dev appium @wdio/cli @wdio/appium-service @wdio/mocha-framework @wdio/local-runner
npx wdio config
```

### Example Test:

```ts
// test/specs/login.e2e.ts

describe('Login Screen', () => {
  it('should log in successfully', async () => {
    const emailField = await $('~email-input');
    const passwordField = await $('~password-input');
    const loginButton = await $('~login-button');

    await emailField.setValue('user@example.com');
    await passwordField.setValue('password123');
    await loginButton.click();

    const welcomeText = await $('~welcome-message');
    expect(await welcomeText.getText()).toBe('Welcome');
  });
});
```

### Run the Test:

Make sure Appium server is running:

```bash
npx appium
npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
```

| Speed                    | Very fast                     | Slower due to black-box style |
| Best For                 | React Native apps             | Cross-platform/full coverage  |
| Setup Complexity         | Medium                        | High                          |

## Tips for Writing Better E2E Tests

- Use `testID` or `accessibilityLabel` for selecting elements
- Keep test cases focused and independent
- Always clean up app state before each test
- Integrate E2E into CI/CD pipelines

## Conclusion

Both Detox and Appium offer robust solutions for E2E testing in React Native. Detox is ideal for speed and tight integration with React Native projects, while Appium offers greater flexibility and platform reach.

Choose the one that fits your project’s goals — or even use both for comprehensive coverage.
