# Interview Questions: Render Patterns in React Native â€“ Render Props, Higher-Order Components, Composition

This document covers key render patterns used in React and React Native development, including **Render Props**, **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**, and **Component Composition**. Understanding these patterns is essential for building reusable, flexible, and maintainable UIs in React Native with TypeScript.

---

## Question 1: What are render patterns in React and why are they important?

**Answer:**  
Render patterns are strategies for **sharing logic or UI behavior between components**. They help improve **code reusability**, **encapsulation**, and **flexibility**. The most common patterns are:

- **Render Props**
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**
- **Component Composition**

---

## Question 2: What is the Render Props pattern?

**Answer:**  
Render Props is a technique where a component receives a function (called a "render prop") as a prop and uses that function to determine what to render.

### ðŸ“¦ Benefits:
- Enables logic reuse between components
- Promotes flexibility in UI rendering

### ðŸ§ª Example (React Native TypeScript):

```tsx
type CounterProps = {
  children : ( count : number , increment : () => void ) => JSX.Element ;
};

const Counter = ( { children } : CounterProps ) => {
  const [ count , setCount ] = useState(0) ;

  const increment = () => setCount( prev => prev + 1 ) ;

  return children( count , increment ) ;
};
```

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Counter>
      { ( count , increment ) => (
        <Button title={ `Clicked ${count} times` } onPress={ increment } />
      ) }
    </Counter>
  ) ;
};
```

## Question 3: What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?

**Answer:**  
An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced behavior. It is used to share logic across multiple components.

### ðŸ“¦ Benefits:
- Extracts and reuses logic
- Keeps components focused on presentation

### ðŸ§ª Example (React Native TypeScript):

```tsx
function withTimestamp<P>( WrappedComponent : React.ComponentType<P & { timestamp : string }> ) {
  return ( props : P ) => {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString() ;
    return <WrappedComponent { ...props } timestamp={ timestamp } /> ;
  };
}

type MessageProps = {
  text : string ;
  timestamp : string ;
};

const Message = ( { text , timestamp } : MessageProps ) => (
  <Text>{ `${text} - ${timestamp}` }</Text>
);

const EnhancedMessage = withTimestamp( Message );
```

## Question 4: What is Component Composition?

**Answer:**  
Component Composition is the most natural and widely used pattern in React. It means building complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components using props and children.

### ðŸ“¦ Benefits:
- Simple and declarative
- Encourages separation of concerns
- Great for layout and container/presenter pattern

### ðŸ§ª Example (React Native TypeScript):

```tsx
const Card = ( { children } : { children : ReactNode } ) => (
  <View style={ { padding : 20 , borderRadius : 10 , backgroundColor : '#eee' } }>
    { children }
  </View>
);

const Title = ( { text } : { text : string } ) => (
  <Text style={ { fontSize : 18 , fontWeight : 'bold' } }>{ text }</Text>
);

const App = () => (
  <Card>
    <Title text="Welcome to Composition!" />
    <Text>This is a description inside the card.</Text>
  </Card>
);
```

## Question 5: When should you use each render pattern?

**Answer:**

| Pattern           | Use Case                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Render Props      | Sharing logic with flexibility in render output |
| HOC               | Enhancing components with shared behavior     |
| Composition       | Structuring UI using reusable building blocks |

---

## Question 6: What are some drawbacks of Render Props and HOCs?

**Answer:**

- **Render Props**:
  - Can lead to deeply nested trees (aka "wrapper hell")
  - Can reduce readability if overused

- **HOCs**:
  - Obscure component names in debugging tools (can fix with `displayName`)
  - May lead to prop name collisions

---

## Summary

- Use **Render Props** to share logic with render control.
- Use **HOCs** to abstract and inject behavior into components.
- Use **Composition** for layout and clean component structure.
- All three patterns are valid, and their use depends on the use case, complexity, and readability goals.

Understanding these patterns is essential for architecting scalable and maintainable React Native applications.
