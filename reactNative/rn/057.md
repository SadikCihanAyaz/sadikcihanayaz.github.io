# Security in React Native: HTTPS Pinning, Certificate Handling, and Secure Token Storage

Securing data and network communication is critical in mobile applications, particularly when dealing with login credentials, tokens, and personal data. This article explains how to implement HTTPS pinning, handle SSL certificates, and securely store tokens using Keychain and Keystore ‚Äî with a focus on React Native using TypeScript.

## üîê HTTPS Pinning

### What is HTTPS pinning?

HTTPS pinning restricts your app to trust **only specific SSL certificates** when making secure requests. Even if a valid certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) is issued to a malicious server, HTTPS pinning will block the connection.

### Why it matters:

- Blocks man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- Prevents tampered Wi-Fi/router interception
- Ensures you're talking to your **real backend**

---

## üõ† How to Implement HTTPS Pinning in React Native

You can use the `react-native-ssl-pinning` library (or `axios` with patching) to enable pinning. This approach works for both Android and iOS.

### Step-by-step setup:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Obtain the SSL certificate from your backend server

You can do this using `openssl` or a browser.

#### Option A: Using `openssl` (recommended for production)

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect yourserver.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -outform DER > your_cert.cer
```

- This generates a `.cer` file in **DER format** from your live backend.

#### Option B: Using Chrome or Firefox

- Visit your backend URL (`https://yourserver.com`)
- Click the lock icon ‚Üí View certificate
- Go to **Details** ‚Üí Export the certificate (in `.cer` format)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Place the certificate in your project

- For **Android**: place the `.cer` file inside:

android/app/src/main/res/raw/your_cert.cer

- For **iOS**: place it inside the Xcode project (usually under the root or `Resources` folder), and ensure it is added to the **Copy Bundle Resources** in Xcode Build Phases.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Configure your request

Use `axios` with `react-native-ssl-pinning`:

```tsx
import axios from 'axios' ;

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL : 'https://yourserver.com' ,
  timeout : 15000 ,
  sslPinning : {
    certs : ['your_cert']  // no .cer extension
  }
}) ;

api.get('/api/secure-endpoint')
  .then(( response ) => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(( error ) => console.error('SSL Pinning Error:', error)) ;
```

---

## üìú Certificate Handling Tips

- **Pin the public key** or the **whole certificate** (DER format preferred).
- Pin multiple certificates if you plan to **rotate** them in the future.
- Never use wildcard domains in the pin ‚Äî be explicit.

---

## üîë Secure Token Storage (Keychain / Keystore)

Authentication tokens (access/refresh tokens) should never be stored in plain `AsyncStorage`.

Instead, use:

- **iOS** ‚Üí Keychain (secure enclave)
- **Android** ‚Üí Keystore system

Use the `react-native-keychain` library for both platforms.

---

### üß™ Token Storage Example

```tsx
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain' ;

// Save token
export const saveToken = async ( token : string ) => {
  await Keychain.setGenericPassword( 'token' , token , {
    accessible : Keychain.ACCESSIBLE.WHEN_UNLOCKED
  }) ;
};

// Read token
export const getToken = async () => {
  const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword() ;
  return credentials ? credentials.password : null ;
};

// Remove token
export const clearToken = async () => {
  await Keychain.resetGenericPassword() ;
};
```

### Why Keychain / Keystore?

- Encrypted by default
- Secure by OS hardware-level APIs
- Not accessible by other apps
- Supports biometric access restrictions (Touch ID, Face ID)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to do

- ‚ùå Do not store tokens in `AsyncStorage`
- ‚ùå Do not ignore failed SSL pinning attempts
- ‚ùå Do not pin a test certificate in production builds

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature              | What it Does                                                       | Tool / Library                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| HTTPS Pinning        | Validates server against expected certificate                      | `react-native-ssl-pinning`       |
| Certificate Handling | Secures connection, avoids fake CAs                                | `.cer` files in DER format       |
| Secure Token Storage | Safely stores auth tokens using hardware encryption                | `react-native-keychain`          |

Implementing these security features helps protect your React Native app from unauthorized access, traffic interception, and token theft ‚Äî especially important in production apps that deal with sensitive or user-related data.
