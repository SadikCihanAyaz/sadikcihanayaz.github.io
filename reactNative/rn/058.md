# Animation APIs in React Native: Animated, LayoutAnimation, and Reanimated

Animations are a key part of building delightful user experiences in mobile apps. React Native provides built-in and community-supported APIs to create smooth, responsive animations. This article explores three major animation approaches in React Native: `Animated`, `LayoutAnimation`, and `Reanimated`. We’ll cover how they work, when to use each, and show examples using React Native with TypeScript.

## 🎯 Animated API

### What is it?

`Animated` is a built-in API provided by React Native that allows you to animate styles using values that update over time. It supports multiple animation types (e.g., `timing`, `spring`, `decay`) and works with various props like `opacity`, `translateX`, `scale`, etc.

### When to use:

- You need fine-grained control over timing and easing
- You want to animate properties like `opacity`, `position`, `scale`, `rotation`
- You’re working with simple continuous animations

### 🧪 Example: Fade-in animation

&&&tsx
import { Animated , View , Text , useEffect , useRef } from 'react-native' ;

const FadeInText = () => {
  const fadeAnim = useRef( new Animated.Value(0) ).current ;

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing( fadeAnim , {
      toValue : 1 ,
      duration : 1000 ,
      useNativeDriver : true
    }).start() ;
  }, []) ;

  return (
    <Animated.View style={ { opacity : fadeAnim } }>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </Animated.View>
  ) ;
};
&&&

## 📐 LayoutAnimation

### What is it?

`LayoutAnimation` is another built-in React Native API that allows you to animate layout changes (e.g., position, size) automatically when a component re-renders.

### When to use:

- You’re toggling visibility or expanding/collapsing views
- You want to animate list insertions/removals
- You don’t need manual control over the animation values

### 🧪 Example: Toggle visibility with animation

&&&tsx
import { LayoutAnimation , UIManager , Platform , View , Text , Button } from 'react-native' ;
import { useState , useEffect } from 'react' ;

if ( Platform.OS === 'android' && UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental ) {
  UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental( true ) ;
}

const ExpandableView = () => {
  const [ visible , setVisible ] = useState( false ) ;

  const toggle = () => {
    LayoutAnimation.configureNext( LayoutAnimation.Presets.easeInEaseOut ) ;
    setVisible( !visible ) ;
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Toggle View" onPress={ toggle } />
      { visible && (
        <View style={ { height : 100 , backgroundColor : 'lightblue' , marginTop : 10 } }>
          <Text>Animated View</Text>
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  ) ;
};
&&&

## ⚡ Reanimated (react-native-reanimated)

### What is it?

`react-native-reanimated` is a powerful third-party animation library that runs animations on the UI thread, allowing for **jank-free, gesture-responsive** animations. It supports both declarative and imperative styles, and is built with performance in mind.

### When to use:

- You’re building gesture-based or interactive animations
- You need animations to run smoothly even when the JS thread is busy
- You want more flexibility than `Animated` or `LayoutAnimation` can offer

### 🧪 Example: Slide animation using Reanimated 2

&&&tsx
import Animated , { useSharedValue , useAnimatedStyle , withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated' ;
import { Button } from 'react-native' ;
import { useState } from 'react' ;

const SlideBox = () => {
  const offset = useSharedValue(0) ;

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      transform : [ { translateX : withTiming( offset.value , { duration : 500 } ) } ]
    } ;
  }) ;

  return (
    <>
      <Button title="Move" onPress={ () => { offset.value += 50 } } />
      <Animated.View style={ [ { width : 100 , height : 100 , backgroundColor : 'tomato' } , animatedStyle ] } />
    </>
  ) ;
};
&&&

## ✅ Summary

React Native offers multiple approaches to animations:

- Use `Animated` for general-purpose visual transitions like fading, sliding, or scaling
- Use `LayoutAnimation` for simple layout changes (toggle visibility, list animations)
- Use `Reanimated` for advanced, smooth, gesture-based or chained animations with low-lag UI responsiveness

Choosing the right animation API depends on the complexity, interactivity, and performance needs of your application.
