# When & Why to Write Native Modules in React Native (Java/Kotlin or Objective-C/Swift)

React Native provides a powerful bridge between JavaScript and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS). Although many use cases are handled by JavaScript and existing libraries, there are scenarios where writing custom **native modules** is necessary or beneficial. This article explains **when**, **why**, and **how** to write native modules, including TypeScript integration examples.

## âœ… When Should You Write Native Modules?

### 1. No Existing JavaScript/Native Library
When you need a feature that has **no third-party React Native library**, native module development becomes essential.

**Examples**:
- Accessing proprietary SDKs (e.g., payment processors, hardware APIs)
- Integrating a companyâ€™s internal native codebase
- Using experimental OS features not yet exposed to JavaScript

### 2. Performance-Critical Operations
When certain operations (e.g., **image processing**, **video encoding**, **cryptography**) are too heavy or slow in JavaScript, writing them natively improves speed.

### 3. Deep Platform Integration
Features like:
- Sensors (gyroscope, barometer)
- Background services
- Bluetooth, NFC
- Android Services or iOS Background Tasks  
often require direct platform APIs and canâ€™t be fully managed with JavaScript.

### 4. Accessing Platform-Specific Features
If your app needs something platform-specific (e.g., iOS Face ID / Android BiometricPrompt), native modules allow you to tap into OS-level APIs directly.

## ðŸ”§ Basic Native Module Flow

### Step 1: Create Native Code

#### Android (Kotlin/Java)

File: `MyModule.kt`

&&&
package com.example;

import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;
import android.widget.Toast;

class MyModule(reactContext: ReactApplicationContext) : ReactContextBaseJavaModule(reactContext) {

  override fun getName(): String {
    return "MyModule";
  }

  @ReactMethod
  fun showToast(message: String) {
    Toast.makeText(reactApplicationContext, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
  }
}
&&&

#### iOS (Swift)

File: `MyModule.swift`

&&&
@objc(MyModule)
class MyModule: NSObject {

  @objc
  func showToast(_ message: String) {
    // iOS doesn't support native toasts but you could use UIAlert or custom view
    print("Native iOS toast: \(message)")
  }

  @objc
  static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
    return true;
  }
}
&&&

---

## Step 2: Register Your Module in JS

Use React Nativeâ€™s `NativeModules` to access it:

&&&
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyModule } = NativeModules;

MyModule.showToast('Hello from Native Code!');
&&&

## ðŸ¤” Why Use Native Modules Instead of a JS Library?

| Reason                       | Native Module Advantage                              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Access native SDKs          | Bridge OS-specific SDKs directly                      |
| Better performance          | Avoid JS-to-native overhead for intensive operations |
| Native UI components        | Embed Android Views or iOS UIViews                   |
| System features             | Direct access to sensors, storage, services, etc.    |
| Reduced dependency bloat    | Build only what you need                             |

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

- **Only write native code if necessary** â€” prefer JavaScript solutions when available.
- Keep native logic minimal and **expose only needed methods** to JS.
- Use **TurboModules** for modern performance improvements (if supported).
- Use TypeScript to strongly type the native interface you expose.
- Document native APIs clearly to help other team members or open source users.

---

## âœ… When NOT to Write Native Code

- When the same functionality can be achieved with a third-party module.
- When the feature doesnâ€™t require high performance or deep system integration.
- When maintaining cross-platform consistency is more important than native behavior.

## Conclusion

Writing native modules in React Native unlocks the full potential of the underlying platforms. It is essential when integrating custom SDKs, accessing system-level APIs, or optimizing performance-critical functionality. By knowing when and why to bridge native code, you can make smarter architectural decisions while keeping your app fast, flexible, and powerful.
