# Interview Questions: Push Notifications in React Native – FCM, APNs, Notifee, and react-native-push-notification

Push notifications are critical in modern mobile apps for alerting users, delivering messages, and encouraging engagement. In React Native, you can integrate push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Apple Push Notification service (APNs), and libraries like Notifee or react-native-push-notification.

This article presents common interview questions and answers related to setting up and managing push notifications in React Native with TypeScript.

## Question 1: What is FCM and how is it used in React Native?

**Answer:**  
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is Google’s service for sending remote push notifications to Android (and optionally iOS) devices. In React Native, it is commonly integrated using `@react-native-firebase/messaging`.

### Key Features:
- Delivery of remote notifications from Firebase or a backend server
- Automatically handles token generation and refresh
- Integration with native Android channels

### Example: Request permission and retrieve FCM token

```tsx
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging' ;

const requestPermissionAndToken = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission() ;
  const enabled = authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ;
  if ( enabled ) {
    const token = await messaging().getToken() ;
    console.log( 'FCM Token:', token ) ;
  }
} ;
```

## Question 2: What is APNs and how do you configure it for iOS?

**Answer:**  
Apple Push Notification service (APNs) is the system for sending push notifications to iOS devices. You configure it by:

- Creating a push key or certificate in Apple Developer Console
- Enabling push capabilities in Xcode (`Signing & Capabilities`)
- Uploading the `.p8` key to Firebase if using FCM for iOS
- Adding `NSRemoteNotification` and `UIBackgroundModes` to `Info.plist`

FCM can act as a bridge to deliver APNs pushes through Firebase’s backend.

## Question 3: What is Notifee and when would you use it?

**Answer:**  
Notifee is a modern React Native library for displaying and managing local and remote notifications with full support for advanced features like:

- Custom notification layouts
- Android notification channels
- iOS categories and actions
- Scheduled and triggered notifications

Use Notifee when you need more control over UI and interaction than Firebase Messaging alone offers.

### Example: Displaying a local notification with Notifee

```tsx
import notifee from '@notifee/react-native' ;

await notifee.displayNotification({
  title : 'Workout Reminder' ,
  body : 'Don’t forget your cardio today!' ,
  android : {
    channelId : 'default'
  }
}) ;
```

## Question 4: What is `react-native-push-notification` and how does it compare to Notifee?

**Answer:**  
`react-native-push-notification` is an older library that allows local and remote notifications but has limitations on newer Android/iOS APIs. It supports:

- Local scheduled notifications
- Remote push notifications (manual setup)
- Badge count, sound, vibration

### Comparison:

| Feature                  | Notifee                          | react-native-push-notification   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Modern API               | ✅ Yes                           | ⚠️ Older API                     |
| Android channels         | ✅ Full support                  | Limited                          |
| iOS category support     | ✅ Yes                           | Basic                            |
| Scheduling               | ✅ Accurate                      | ✅ Supported                     |
| UI customization         | ✅ Rich styles                   | Basic                            |

Use Notifee for modern apps that require better styling, control, and OS integration.

## Question 5: How do you handle user permissions for notifications?

**Answer:**  
Always ask permission before sending notifications, especially on iOS. Use Firebase Messaging or Notifee’s permission APIs.

```tsx
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging' ;

const askNotificationPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission() ;
  return authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ;
} ;
```

For Notifee:

```tsx
import notifee , { AuthorizationStatus } from '@notifee/react-native' ;

const checkPermission = async () => {
  const settings = await notifee.requestPermission() ;
  return settings.authorizationStatus === AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ;
} ;
```

## Question 6: How do you handle push notification taps and deep linking?

**Answer:**  
When a user taps on a notification, you can capture the event and navigate to a specific screen using your navigation logic.

With Firebase Messaging:

```tsx
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging' ;

useEffect(() => {
  messaging().onNotificationOpenedApp( remoteMessage => {
    console.log( 'User tapped:', remoteMessage.notification ) ;
    // navigate based on message data
  }) ;
}, []) ;
```

With Notifee:

```tsx
notifee.onForegroundEvent( ({ type , detail }) => {
  if ( type === EventType.PRESS ) {
    console.log( 'Notification tapped', detail.notification ) ;
  }
}) ;
```

## Question 7: How do you manage notification channels on Android?

**Answer:**  
Android 8.0+ requires a notification channel for each type of notification. Notifee makes this simple:

```tsx
await notifee.createChannel({
  id : 'default' ,
  name : 'Default Channel' ,
  importance : AndroidImportance.HIGH
}) ;
```

---

## Summary

- **FCM** and **APNs** handle the delivery of remote push notifications
- **Notifee** provides advanced UI control and customization
- **react-native-push-notification** is suitable for simpler needs but is less modern
- Always handle **permissions**, **token management**, and **notification taps**
- Set up **channels** and **categories** for better OS support

Understanding these tools is essential for implementing a robust push notification system in any React Native app.
