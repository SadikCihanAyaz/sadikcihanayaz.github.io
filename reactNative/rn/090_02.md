Here’s how a typical React Native pipeline breaks down into CI, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment stages:

1. Trigger (Push / PR)  
   - **Type:** CI  
   - **What happens:** GitHub Actions fires when you push code or open a pull request.

2. Checkout & Install  
   - **Type:** CI  
   - **What happens:**  
     - `actions/checkout@v4` clones your repo  
     - `npm ci` / `yarn install` brings in JS deps  
     - (iOS) `pod install` installs CocoaPods

3. Static Analysis  
   - **Type:** CI  
   - **What happens:**  
     - `npm run lint` (ESLint)  
     - `npx tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript type-check)  

4. Automated Tests  
   - **Type:** CI  
   - **What happens:**  
     - Unit tests (`npm test`)  
     - Integration or snapshot tests (Jest)  
     - Optional E2E (Detox)

5. Build Artifacts  
   - **Type:** CI  
   - **What happens:**  
     - Android: `./gradlew bundleRelease` → AAB  
     - iOS: `xcodebuild` or `fastlane build_app` → .ipa  

6. Upload Artifacts (Staging)  
   - **Type:** Continuous Delivery  
   - **What happens:**  
     - Android AAB → Google Play Internal track (via Fastlane)  
     - iOS .ipa → TestFlight (via Fastlane’s `upload_to_testflight`)  
   - **Why CD:** Your app is packaged and delivered to a staging environment or beta testers, ready for QA.

7. Manual QA / Approval  
   - **Type:** Continuous Delivery  
   - **What happens:**  
     - Testers verify on TestFlight or Play Internal  
     - Team gives sign-off (or fixes bugs and repeats CI)

8. Production Release  
   - **Type:** Continuous Deployment (if fully automated)  
   - **What happens:**  
     - On merge of a “release” tag or on-demand via `workflow_dispatch`, Fastlane runs `upload_to_app_store` and `upload_to_play_store`  
     - Users see the new version in public app stores

9. Monitoring & Rollback  
   - **Type:** Continuous Deployment  
   - **What happens:**  
     - Crashlytics/Sentry catch errors in production  
     - If failure spike detected, Fastlane can trigger a rollback lane or you manually revert and redeploy


-	Steps 1–5 are all part of Continuous Integration: merging, linting, testing, and building your code.
-	Steps 6–7 form Continuous Delivery: packaging and delivering to a non-prod/testing environment and waiting for approval.
-	Step 8 is Continuous Deployment: automatically pushing to production once tests and approvals pass.
-	Step 9 closes the loop with automated monitoring and rollback, ensuring reliability in production.
