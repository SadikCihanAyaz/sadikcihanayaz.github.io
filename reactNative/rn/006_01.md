# React Native Interview Questions: Syntax Sugar â€“ Destructuring, Rest, Spread, and Template Literals

These interview questions focus on modern JavaScript (ES6+) **syntax sugar** features commonly used in React Native development with TypeScript. Mastery of these concepts leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

## ðŸ§© Destructuring

### 1. What is destructuring in JavaScript? How is it useful in React Native?

**Expected Answer**: Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. In React Native, it's especially useful for extracting props or state values for easier access and cleaner code.

---

### 2. Given the following component, what is being destructured?

```js
type Props = {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
};

const Header = ({ title } : Props) : JSX.Element => {
  return <Text>{title}</Text>;
};
```

**Expected Answer**: Only the `title` property is destructured from the `Props` object.

---

### 3. How would you destructure the second item from an array?

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
// Extract only 'green'
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const [ , secondColor ] = colors;
console.log(secondColor); // green
```

---

## ðŸŒª Rest Parameters

### 4. What does the rest operator do in JavaScript?

**Expected Answer**: The rest operator (`...`) gathers the remaining items of an object or array into a new variable.

---

### 5. What will this return?

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 25,
  role: 'admin',
};

const { name, ...rest } = user;

console.log(rest);
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
{ age: 25, role: 'admin' }
```

---

## ðŸ“¤ Spread Operator

### 6. What is the spread operator and how is it different from the rest operator?

**Expected Answer**: The spread operator expands or clones values from an iterable (array/object), while the rest operator collects remaining items. They use the same syntax but serve opposite purposes.

---

### 7. What does the following do?

```js
const defaults = { fontSize: 14, color: 'black' };
const custom = { color: 'blue' };
const merged = { ...defaults, ...custom };
console.log(merged);
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
{ fontSize: 14, color: 'blue' }
```

---

## ðŸ”¤ Template Literals

### 8. What are template literals, and how do they differ from regular strings?

**Expected Answer**: Template literals use backticks (\`\`) and allow embedded expressions using `${}`. Theyâ€™re often used for building dynamic strings and multi-line text.

---

### 9. Rewrite this using a template literal:

```js
const name = 'Sarah';
const greeting = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

---

### 10. How are template literals used in URL construction?

```js
const userId = 99;
// Construct this: 'https://api.app.com/users/99'
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const url = `https://api.app.com/users/${userId}`;
```

---

## âœ… Bonus Practice

### 11. Destructure `props` and log the `username`:

```js
type Props = {
  username: string;
  isLoggedIn: boolean;
};

const Welcome = (props : Props) => {
  // Write your code here
};
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const Welcome = ({ username } : Props) => {
  console.log(username);
};
```

## Conclusion

These questions help assess a candidateâ€™s familiarity with modern JavaScript syntax features and their ability to use them in React Native with TypeScript. Mastery of **destructuring**, **rest/spread**, and **template literals** contributes to writing clean, readable, and efficient code.
