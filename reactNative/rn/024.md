## Event handling Reacts synthetic events cross-platform quirks


🧠 What is a Synthetic Event?
-----------------------------

A **Synthetic Event** in React and React Native is a **wrapper around the native event system** that behaves **the same way across all platforms and browsers** (or OSes in mobile).

> ✅ It is **not the real OS event**, but a **React-controlled object** that **normalizes** the differences between platforms.

* * * * *

### 🧪 Why Synthetic Events?

On the web:

-   Different browsers handle events (click, input, keypress) differently.

-   React wraps these in **SyntheticEvent** to give you a consistent interface.

In **React Native**:

-   Different platforms (iOS, Android) use different native event systems.

-   React Native uses **SyntheticEvent** to unify and normalize touch, keyboard, and scroll behaviors.

* * * * *

### ✅ What it does:

-   Unifies properties: `event.nativeEvent` will give consistent data across platforms.

-   Normalizes lifecycle: adds common methods like `preventDefault`, `stopPropagation` (even if not all native systems support them the same way).

-   Makes it **cross-platform safe** to write handlers.

* * * * *

### 📦 Example: Press Event

```js
function handlePress(event) {
// This is a SyntheticEvent\
console.log(event.nativeEvent.locationX); // works on iOS + Android\
}
```

If this was a native event, the property might:

-   Be `event.offsetX` in some browsers or `event.x` in others (on web)

-   Behave differently between iOS and Android

But with **SyntheticEvent**, it's **always `nativeEvent.locationX`**, regardless of the platform.

* * * * *

### 🔍 Key Properties

The event passed to a handler (like `onPress`, `onScroll`) is:

-   A **SyntheticEvent**

-   It contains:

    -   `nativeEvent` → The raw event details from the OS (touch position, timestamp, etc.)

    -   Optional helper methods: `.preventDefault()`, `.stopPropagation()` (limited use in RN)

* * * * *

### ✅ Summary

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Synthetic Event | React's **cross-platform event wrapper** |
| Purpose | Ensures **consistent event behavior** across iOS, Android, and web |
| Key property | `event.nativeEvent` --- holds platform-native details |
| Used in | `onPress`, `onScroll`, `onSubmitEditing`, `onResponderMove`, etc. |

**Overview**

React Native uses SyntheticEvent wrapper normalizing native events  
Handlers receive a synthetic event object with persistent properties  

**Common event types**

- touch events onPress onLongPress onPressIn onPressOut  
- gesture responder events onStartShouldSetResponder onResponderMove  
- keyboard events onKeyPress onSubmitEditing  
- scroll events onScroll  

**Cross platform quirks**

- Android ripple effect onPress does not exist on iOS  
- onPress delay on iOS to distinguish double tap  
- TouchableOpacity vs Pressable for fine control  
- KeyboardAvoidingView behavior differs between platforms  

**Basic onPress example**

Define a button handler managing synthetic event

```typescript
import React, { useState } from react
import { View, Text, Pressable } from react-native

function TapCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handlePress(event) {
    // event.nativeEvent contains locationX locationY
    setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 16 }}>
      <Pressable onPress={handlePress} style={{ padding: 12, backgroundColor: '#007aff', borderRadius: 4 }}>
        <Text style={{ color: '#ffffff' }}>Tapped {count} times</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}

export default TapCounter;
```

**Gesture responder example**

Use responder system for drag interactions

```typescript
import React, { useRef } from react
import { View, PanResponder, Animated } from react-native

function DraggableBox() {
  const pan = useRef(new Animated.ValueXY()).current;

  const responder = PanResponder.create({
    onStartShouldSetResponder () true,
    onMoveShouldSetResponder () true,
    onResponderMove (event, gestureState) {
      pan.setValue({ x: gestureState.dx, y: gestureState.dy });
    },
    onResponderRelease () {
      Animated.spring(pan, { toValue: { x: 0, y: 0 }, useNativeDriver: true }).start();
    }
  });

  return (
    <Animated.View
      style={[{ width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: '#ff0000' }, pan.getLayout()]}
      {...responder.panHandlers}
    />
  );
}

export default DraggableBox;
```

**Tips**

- prefer Pressable for unified feedback control  
- inspect event.nativeEvent properties for platform differences  
- clean up long press timers using onPressOut to avoid stuck state  
- consider useNativeDriver true for animations to offload JS thread  

Understanding synthetic events ensures consistent UX across iOS Android and web
