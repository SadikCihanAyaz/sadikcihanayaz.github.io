## JSX & reconciliation

JSX lets you write UI trees in a declarative way. Under the hood React Native transforms JSX into native view operations. Reconciliation is the process by which React compares the new JSX tree against the previous one and applies minimal updates to the native UI.

### Virtual DOM diffing

When state or props change React builds a new Virtual DOM tree. It then runs a diff algorithm against the previous tree to find changed nodes. Only those nodes are updated on the native side, avoiding full re-renders.

### Keys in lists

Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added or removed. Always assign a stable key to each list element.

```typescript
import React from react-native
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from react-native

interface Item {
  id number
  label string
}

interface ListProps {
  items Item[]
  onSelect (id number) void
}

function ItemList(props ListProps) {
  return (
    <View>
      {props.items.map((item, index) => (
        <TouchableOpacity
          key={item.id}
          onPress={() => props.onSelect(item.id)}
        >
          <Text>Item {item.label}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      ))}
    </View>
  )
}
```

### Why keys matter

- Without keys React reuses components incorrectly leading to stale state  
- Keys must be unique among siblings but stable across renders  
- Using array index as key can cause problems when list order changes

### Best practices

- Use database identifiers or UUIDs as keys  
- Avoid generating keys on the fly in render  
- Keep keys consistent even if list items reorder

By mastering JSX and reconciliation with proper keys you ensure efficient updates and a smooth user experience in React Native apps
