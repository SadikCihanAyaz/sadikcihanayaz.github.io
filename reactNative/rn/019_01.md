# React Native TypeScript Interview Questions — Context API Step-by-Step

This article walks through the steps required to build a **fully typed and safe Context API setup** using React Native with TypeScript. Each step is paired with a related interview question.

## Step 1: Define a context type

### ❓ Interview Question 1:
**Why should we define a separate context type when using Context API with TypeScript?**

**Answer:**  
Defining a separate context type ensures strong type checking and allows the context to include multiple values (e.g., both data and setters). Without this, passing anything beyond the defined type will cause TypeScript errors.

```tsx
interface NameContextType {
    data : UserNameData | undefined ;
    setData : ( data : UserNameData ) => void ;
}
```

## Step 2: Create the context with that type

### ❓ Interview Question 2:
**How do you create a context using the defined context type?**

**Answer:**  
You use `createContext` and pass `undefined` initially for better runtime safety and null-checking logic later.

```tsx
const NameContext = createContext<NameContextType | undefined>(undefined) ;
```

## Step 3: Build a custom hook to consume the context

### ❓ Interview Question 3:
**Why should we use a custom hook to consume the context instead of using `useContext` directly everywhere?**

**Answer:**  
A custom hook allows you to centralize error handling, ensuring that the context is not consumed outside its provider. It also improves readability and developer experience.

```tsx
export const useName = () => {
    const context = useContext(NameContext) ;
    if ( !context ) {
        throw new Error("useName must be used within a NameProvider") ;
    }
    return context ;
} ;
```

## Step 4: Create the provider and manage internal state

### ❓ Interview Question 4:
**How do you create a provider that holds and updates context data?**

**Answer:**  
You define a `useState` inside the provider and pass both the state and setter as the context value.

```tsx
const NameProvider = ( { children } : NameProviderProps ) => {
    const [ data , setData ] = useState<UserNameData | undefined>(undefined) ;

    return (
        <NameContext.Provider value={ { data , setData } }>
            { children }
        </NameContext.Provider>
    ) ;
} ;
```

## Step 5: Wrap your app or component tree with the provider

### ❓ Interview Question 5:
**Where should the provider be used in a typical React Native app?**

**Answer:**  
You should wrap the root component (or any subtree where the context is needed) with the provider to give access to its context values.

```tsx
const App = () => {
    return (
        <NameProvider>
            <MainScreen />
        </NameProvider>
    ) ;
} ;
```

## Step 6: Use the context data inside components

### ❓ Interview Question 6:
**How can we access and update context data inside a functional component?**

**Answer:**  
Use the custom hook to destructure and use `data` and `setData` inside your component.

```tsx
const MainScreen = () => {
    const { data , setData } = useName() ;

    const handleUpdate = () => {
        setData( { name : "Ali" , count : 1 , countryName : "TR" } ) ;
    } ;

    return (
        <View>
            <Text>{ data?.name }</Text>
            <Button title="Update Name" onPress={ handleUpdate } />
        </View>
    ) ;
} ;
```

## Summary

- Define a context value type for strong typing.
- Use `createContext` with `undefined` to allow null-checking.
- Create a custom hook for clean and safe consumption.
- Provide both data and setData via `Provider`.
- Wrap relevant parts of the app with the provider.
- Access and mutate context inside components via the custom hook.

This is a best-practice Context API pattern for React Native TypeScript apps and will likely appear in intermediate or advanced React interviews.
