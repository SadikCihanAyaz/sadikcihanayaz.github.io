# React Native Interview Questions: Closure, `this`, Arrow Functions, and Hoisting

These core JavaScript concepts‚Äî**closures**, **`this` binding**, **arrow functions**, and **hoisting**‚Äîare essential in day-to-day React Native development. Below is a set of technical interview questions and answers tailored for React Native developers using **TypeScript**. Each concept is paired with relevant code examples.

## üîí Closure Questions

### 1. What is a closure in JavaScript?

**Answer**: A closure is a function that has access to its outer function‚Äôs variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

### 2. Can you give a React Native example of how a closure can retain state?

```
const useLogger = () : (() => void) => {
  let count = 0;

  return () => {
    count += 1;
    console.log('Clicked', count, 'times');
  };
};

const logger = useLogger();
logger(); // Clicked 1 times
logger(); // Clicked 2 times
```

## ü§î `this` Context Questions

### 3. What does `this` refer to in a class component method?

**Answer**: In a React class component, `this` typically refers to the instance of the component, unless the method is unbound.

### 4. How do you fix `this` undefined in a class method?

**Answer**: You can either bind it in the constructor or use an arrow function.

### 5. Example: What will this output?

```
class Example extends React.Component {
  message: string = 'Hello';

  showMessage() {
    console.log(this.message);
  }

  render() {
    const { showMessage } = this;
    showMessage(); // What will this log?
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Answer**: It will throw an error (`this` is undefined) unless `showMessage` is bound to the instance.

## üèπ Arrow Function Questions

### 6. What is the difference between a normal function and an arrow function in terms of `this`?

**Answer**: Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`. They capture the `this` from the surrounding scope.

### 7. How does arrow function help in React Native event handlers?

```
<Button title="Click" onPress={() => this.handleClick()} />
```

**Answer**: Using an arrow function avoids the need to bind `this` in the constructor and keeps the correct context.

## ü™Ñ Hoisting Questions

### 8. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

**Answer**: Hoisting is JavaScript‚Äôs default behavior of moving declarations (not initializations) to the top of their scope.

### 9. Will this work?

```
console.log(value); // undefined or error?
var value = 5;
```

**Answer**: It logs `undefined`. The declaration is hoisted, but the assignment is not.

### 10. How about with `let` or `const`?

```
console.log(name); // What happens?
let name = 'React Native';
```

**Answer**: It throws a `ReferenceError` due to the temporal dead zone.

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaways

- Use closures for encapsulated logic like counters or memoization in hooks.
- Always ensure correct `this` binding in class components or use arrow functions.
- Arrow functions help with concise syntax and preserve context.
- Know what variables are hoisted (e.g., `var`) and which are not (`let`, `const`, `function` in blocks).

These questions help evaluate a developer‚Äôs deep understanding of JavaScript fundamentals within a React Native context.
