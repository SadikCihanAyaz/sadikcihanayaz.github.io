# CI/CD & DevOps for React Native ‚Äì Interview Questions and Answers

This document includes common **CI/CD and DevOps interview questions** related to React Native projects using **GitHub Actions**, **Bitrise**, and **Fastlane** ‚Äì along with model answers and examples using **TypeScript-based** React Native setups.

---

## üìò Section 1: GitHub Actions

**Q1.** What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in React Native CI pipelines?

**A1.** GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool built into GitHub that enables workflow automation. In React Native, it's used to run tests, check linting, build apps, and optionally run Fastlane or deploy apps when code is pushed or a PR is opened.

---

**Q2.** Explain the purpose of the `runs-on` and `steps` fields in a GitHub Actions workflow file.

**A2.**
- `runs-on` defines the OS for the virtual machine (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
- `steps` are the actions/tasks like checking out the repo, installing dependencies, running tests, etc.

---

**Q3.** How would you configure a workflow to:
- Run `npm install`
- Execute unit tests
- Run TypeScript compilation check
- Trigger only on pull requests to the `main` branch

```yaml
name: React Native CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - run: npm install
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - run: npm test
```

---

**Q4.** How do you handle environment variables securely in GitHub Actions?

**A4.** Use GitHub Secrets. Navigate to your repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí create new secrets. Access them in workflows using `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.

---

**Q5.** What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GitHub Actions for mobile builds compared to Bitrise?

**A5.**

| GitHub Actions                       | Bitrise                            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Free for open-source                | Has free tier with build minutes   |
| Flexible and customizable           | Mobile-specific UI and integrations|
| Requires manual setup for iOS builds| Has prebuilt iOS & Android steps   |

---

## üìò Section 2: Bitrise

**Q6.** What is Bitrise and how does it differ from GitHub Actions?

**A6.** Bitrise is a CI/CD platform tailored for mobile apps. It offers ready-to-use steps for building, testing, and deploying Android/iOS apps. Unlike GitHub Actions, Bitrise provides visual workflows and native integrations for signing and store deployments.

---

**Q7.** Describe the general steps in a Bitrise workflow for a React Native app.

**A7.**
1. Git Clone
2. Install Dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Run Tests (`npm test`)
4. Android/iOS Build
5. Deploy with Fastlane or internal tools

---

**Q8.** How do you configure a Bitrise step to install dependencies and run unit tests in a TypeScript project?

**A8.** Add the following steps in the workflow editor:
- **Script Step**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm test
  npx tsc --noEmit
  ```

---

**Q9.** Bitrise has a concept of ‚ÄúSecrets.‚Äù What are they and how are they typically used?

**A9.** Secrets are encrypted environment variables used to store sensitive data like API keys, keystore passwords, and Apple credentials. They're accessed in scripts via `$SECRET_NAME`.

---

**Q10.** Can Bitrise be used for code signing and store deployment? If yes, how?

**A10.** Yes. Bitrise can:
- Upload and manage code signing files (e.g., provisioning profiles, keystores)
- Integrate Fastlane or native deploy steps (e.g., Deploy to App Store Connect, Google Play)

---

## üìò Section 3: Fastlane

**Q11.** What is Fastlane and what problems does it solve in React Native development?

**A11.** Fastlane is a tool to automate app signing, building, and release. It helps with:
- Automating TestFlight uploads
- Google Play deployments
- Managing certificates and provisioning profiles
- Version bumping

---

**Q12.** Write a Fastlane lane that builds an Android app bundle and uploads it to the Play Store‚Äôs internal testing track.

**A12.**

```ruby
lane :internal_release do
  gradle(
    task: "bundle",
    build_type: "Release"
  )

  upload_to_play_store(
    track: "internal"
  )
end
```

---

**Q13.** Write a Fastlane lane that builds an iOS app and uploads it to TestFlight.

**A13.**

```ruby
lane :beta do
  build_app(scheme: "YourApp")
  upload_to_testflight
end
```

---

**Q14.** How do you manage signing credentials with Fastlane in a secure and scalable way?

**A14.** Use **Match**, Fastlane's tool for syncing signing credentials via a secure Git repo. Store the encryption passphrase as an environment variable or secret.

---

**Q15.** What are the differences between using Fastlane manually vs. invoking it from GitHub Actions or Bitrise?

**A15.**
- **Manually:** Run lanes locally via terminal (good for local testing).
- **CI tools:** Automate lanes in workflows (preferred for consistency and repeatability across teams).

---

## üìò Section 4: Combined Usage & Best Practices

**Q16.** How would you structure your CI/CD pipeline for a production React Native app targeting both Android and iOS?

**A16.**
- GitHub Actions or Bitrise for:
  - PR checks (lint, test, build)
  - Merges to `main` trigger production builds
- Fastlane for:
  - Signing
  - Store deployment (TestFlight, Google Play)

---

**Q17.** What steps would you include to ensure that releases are tested, signed, and deployed automatically?

**A17.**
1. Run tests
2. Compile TypeScript
3. Build release binaries
4. Sign the builds (Fastlane Match or Bitrise Code Signing)
5. Deploy via Fastlane

---

**Q18.** How would you design the following CI/CD process?

- Run lint and unit tests on every PR
- Build artifacts on merge to `main`
- Deploy to TestFlight (iOS) and Play Store internal (Android) on manual trigger

**A18.**
- **GitHub Actions** for PR + build on merge
- **Bitrise** with manual trigger workflow to run Fastlane `beta` (iOS) and `internal_release` (Android)

---

**Q19.** How do you handle versioning and changelogs in CI/CD pipelines?

**A19.** Use tools like:
- `standard-version` or `semantic-release` for automated version bumps
- Generate changelogs from commits
- Inject version into Fastlane with `increment_version_code` / `increment_build_number`

---

**Q20.** What are the common pitfalls or challenges you‚Äôve faced when configuring mobile CI/CD pipelines, and how did you solve them?

**A20.**
- **Slow iOS builds on GitHub Actions** ‚Üí Use Bitrise macOS VMs
- **Code signing issues** ‚Üí Use Fastlane Match and store secrets securely
- **Inconsistent build cache** ‚Üí Clear node_modules/cache and re-run builds on failure

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: Code Sample Question

**Q21.** Review the GitHub Actions config below and explain what it does:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm test
```

**A21.** This workflow runs on PRs targeting `main`. It:
1. Checks out the repo
2. Sets Node.js to version 18
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs linting and tests

To add a Fastlane call:

```yaml
      - run: bundle install
      - run: bundle exec fastlane internal_release
```
