# React Native Interview Questions: Async Patterns (JavaScript, ESNext, TypeScript)

Mastery of asynchronous patterns is critical for React Native developers. These questions assess a candidate's understanding of **Promises**, **async/await**, **parallel execution**, **error handling**, and **TypeScript typing** within real-world React Native scenarios.

---

## üîÅ Promises

### 1. What is a Promise in JavaScript, and how is it used in React Native?

**Expected Answer**: A Promise represents an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. In React Native, Promises are often used for API calls, animations, or storage operations.

---

### 2. What is the output of the following Promise chain?

```js
const task = () : Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('done'), 1000);
  });
};

task().then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
  return 'next';
}).then((val) => {
  console.log(val);
});
```

**Expected Output**:
- `done`
- `next`

## ‚è≥ Async/Await

### 3. Convert the following function into async/await syntax:

```js
function getUserData() {
  return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data.name);
    });
}
```

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const getUserData = async () : Promise<void> => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data.name);
};
```

---

### 4. What happens if you forget to use `await` in an async function?

**Expected Answer**: The function continues executing without waiting for the Promise to resolve, which may lead to undefined values or unexpected behavior.

---

## üîÑ Parallel Async Tasks

### 5. How would you fetch two endpoints in parallel and wait for both responses?

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const loadData = async () : Promise<void> => {
  const [users, posts] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users').then(res => res.json()),
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts').then(res => res.json()),
  ]);
  console.log(users.length, posts.length);
};
```

---

## üö´ Error Handling

### 6. What's the correct way to handle errors in an async function?

**Expected Answer**:

```js
const getData = async () : Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```

---

## ‚úÖ TypeScript Typing

### 7. How do you type an async function that returns a user object?

**Expected Answer**:

```js
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

const getUser = async () : Promise<User> => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1');
  return await response.json();
};
```

---

## üß™ Conceptual Questions

### 8. What is the difference between `Promise.all` and `Promise.allSettled`?

**Expected Answer**:
- `Promise.all` rejects as soon as one Promise fails.
- `Promise.allSettled` waits for all Promises to finish and returns both fulfilled and rejected results.

---

### 9. When would you use `for await...of` in a React Native project?

**Expected Answer**: When dealing with asynchronous iteration, such as streaming data, paginated API calls, or handling a sequence of async tasks one by one.

---

### 10. What‚Äôs a common pitfall when using async/await inside `useEffect`?

**Expected Answer**: You cannot directly make the `useEffect` callback async. You should define and call an inner async function instead.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const load = async () => {
    await fetchData();
  };
  load();
}, []);
```

## üèÅ Final Notes

These questions are designed to test practical understanding of asynchronous patterns with React Native and TypeScript. Mastery of these concepts ensures smoother data flows, better error handling, and overall more robust mobile applications.
