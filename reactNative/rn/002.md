## React Native plus TypeScript Project Setup Guide

Below is a step by step guide to bootstrap a new React Native plus TypeScript project using both bare workflow and Expo workflow along with key differences

## Prerequisites and Setup

- Install Node js LTS and Yarn or npm  
- Install Visual Studio Code with ESLint Prettier React Native Tools extensions  
- On macOS install Xcode and CocoaPods via sudo gem install cocoapods  
- Install Android Studio and Android SDK and configure ANDROID_HOME and PATH  
- Use React Native CLI via npx react-native

## Bare React Native plus TypeScript (no Expo)

1. Create the project  
   npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-typescript  
   cd MyApp

2. iOS support on macOS  
   cd ios  
   pod install  
   cd ..

3. Android support  
   Ensure ANDROID_HOME and PATH point to your SDK  
   Open the android folder in Android Studio if needed

4. Run on simulator or device  
   npx react-native run-ios  
   npx react-native run-android

5. Editor and linting  
   Review generated tsconfig json  
   Add ESLint and Prettier config for ts and tsx files

6. TypeScript usage  
   Rename JS files to TS or TSX  
   Define component props with interface or type  
   Example interface Props title string  
   const MyComponent React.FC Props equals destructuring title arrow body

## Expo plus TypeScript

1. Install Expo CLI  
   npm install -g expo-cli

2. Initialize project  
   npx expo init MyExpoApp  
   Choose the blank TypeScript template

3. Run the app  
   cd MyExpoApp  
   expo start  
   Scan QR code in Expo Go or press i or a to launch simulators

## Expo versus Bare Workflow Key Differences

- Setup speed  
  Expo launches nearly instantly with no native toolchain  
  Bare requires Xcode and Android Studio installations

- Native modules  
  Expo supports built in modules until you eject  
  Bare allows adding any native library via CocoaPods or Gradle

- Over the air updates  
  Expo uses built in Updates  
  Bare uses CodePush or custom solution

- Build pipelines  
  Expo offers EAS Build or cloud builds  
  Bare requires manual Xcode schemes and Gradle tasks

- Binary size  
  Expo runtime makes apps larger  
  Bare yields leaner binaries with only included modules

- Customization  
  Expo is limited until eject  
  Bare gives full control over native projects and signing

## Next Steps

- Tooling and CI CD  
  Add ESLint Prettier and Husky for pre commit hooks  
  Configure TypeScript path aliases  
  Set up GitHub Actions or Bitrise for automated builds and tests

- Navigation  
  Install and configure React Navigation or Wix React Native Navigation with TypeScript

- State Management  
  Choose Context plus useReducer Redux Toolkit MobX Recoil or similar

- Native APIs and Modules  
  Integrate camera notifications geolocation via community packages or custom modules

- Deployment  
  Use Fastlane for automated signing and release  
  Consider CodePush for bare or Updates for managed Expo apps
