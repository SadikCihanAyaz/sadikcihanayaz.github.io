## 1.1 JavaScript, ESNext & TypeScript Fundamentals in React Native : Closures

# Understanding Closures in React Native TypeScript

A **closure** lets an inner function retain access to variables defined in its outer function even after that outer function has finished executing In React Native TypeScript closures enable encapsulation of state and logic in hooks and utilities

## Real-World Example Debounced Search Hook

Flooding backend with a network request on every keystroke hurts UX and performance A debounced hook uses a closure to remember the latest input and cancel previous timers automatically

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from react
import { TextInput, FlatList, View, Text } from react-native

function useDebouncedValue(value number, delay number) {
  const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebounced(value)
    }, delay)

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timer)
    }
  }, [value, delay])

  return debounced
}

export function SearchScreen() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(empty)
  const [results, setResults] = useState(empty array)
  const debouncedQuery = useDebouncedValue(query, 500)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedQuery.length > 0) {
      fetch(https://api.example.com/search?q=${debouncedQuery})
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => setResults(data.items))
    }
  }, [debouncedQuery])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex 1, padding 16 }}>
      <TextInput
        placeholder=Type to search
        onChangeText=setQuery
        value=query
        style={{ marginBottom 12, borderWidth 1, padding 8 }}
      />
      <FlatList
        data=results
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```

### Why This Works

- The inner callback for setTimeout captures value and delay from outer scope  
- When value or delay changes effect cleanup clears old timer and new one uses latest values  
- Component sees only final stabilized input after delay

## Benefits of Using Closures

- Performance Optimization  
  Batch rapid changes and reduce renders or network calls  
- Cleaner Components  
  Keep timing logic inside a hook rather than clutter component body  
- Reusability  
  Share debouncing logic across screens without duplication  
- State Privacy  
  Internal timers and intermediate values are hidden

## Negative Sides & Pitfalls

- Stale Closures  
  Forgetting dependencies in useEffect leads to outdated captured values  
- Memory Leaks  
  Failing to clear timers or subscriptions can retain references too long  
- Overhead  
  Delays add milliseconds of latency and complicate debugging  
- Complexity  
  Deeply nested closures or new functions each render can hurt readability and testability

## When to Use Closures in React Native

- Debounced or throttled input handlers for search or scroll  
- Custom hooks for polling geolocation or animation timers  
- Module level caches to share data without global state  
- Factory functions generating parameterized event handlers

Closures power many advanced React Native patterns Master them to write efficient encapsulated reusable code while being mindful of cleanup and dependencies
