# CI/CD & DevOps in React Native with GitHub Actions, Bitrise, and Fastlane

Setting up a proper **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** pipeline is essential for React Native apps. It ensures automated testing, building, code quality checks, and streamlined release management for both Android and iOS platforms.

This article walks through implementing CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **Bitrise**, and **Fastlane** for a React Native project written in TypeScript.

---

## Goals of CI/CD in React Native

- Run tests automatically on every pull request
- Build Android/iOS apps for staging/production
- Sign and deploy builds to TestFlight, Play Store, or internal testers
- Enforce code quality and lint checks

---

## 1. GitHub Actions: Automated CI

GitHub Actions allows automating workflows directly in your GitHub repo.

### Example: CI Workflow to Build and Test

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: React Native CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run TypeScript type checks
        run: npx tsc --noEmit

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Run lint checks
        run: npm run lint
```

### Add a custom script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx"
  }
}
```

## 2. Bitrise: Mobile-First CI/CD for React Native

[Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io) is tailored for mobile apps and integrates natively with React Native, Fastlane, Expo, and store deployments.

### Setup:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Bitrise
2. Select React Native as your project type
3. Configure **workflows** (build, test, deploy)

### Example Workflow Steps:

- Git Clone
- Install Node Modules (`npm install`)
- Run tests (`npm test`)
- Android Build
- iOS Build
- Deploy via Fastlane

Bitrise offers both cloud-hosted simulators and secure environment variable storage (e.g., `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`, `APPLE_API_KEY`).

## 3. Fastlane: Automate Signing and Deployment

Fastlane is the de facto tool for automating Android and iOS release pipelines.

### Install Fastlane:

```bash
brew install fastlane
```

### Android: `fastlane/Fastfile`

```ruby
default_platform(:android)

platform :android do
  desc "Build and upload to Play Store internal track"
  lane :internal_release do
    gradle(
      task: "bundle",
      build_type: "Release"
    )

    upload_to_play_store(
      track: "internal"
    )
  end
end
```

### iOS: `fastlane/Fastfile`

```ruby
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  desc "Build and upload to TestFlight"
  lane :beta do
    build_app(scheme: "YourApp")
    upload_to_testflight
  end
end
```

### Environment Variables

Use `.env` or Bitrise Secrets to define:

- `MATCH_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`

---

## Integrating Fastlane in CI

In **GitHub Actions** or **Bitrise**, add:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane internal_release
# or
bundle exec fastlane beta
```

---

## Folder Structure Suggestion

```text
project-root/
├── android/
├── ios/
├── fastlane/
│   ├── Fastfile
│   └── Appfile
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── src/
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Summary

| Tool          | Purpose                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Lightweight CI, ideal for open-source & simple pipelines |
| **Bitrise**        | Mobile-centric CI/CD with visual workflows |
| **Fastlane**       | Build, sign, and publish apps to stores |

---

## Conclusion

With GitHub Actions, Bitrise, and Fastlane, you can create a powerful and reliable CI/CD pipeline for your React Native TypeScript project. Automating builds and releases not only saves time but also improves quality and reduces human error during deployment.

Use GitHub Actions for quick workflows, Bitrise for mobile-focused builds, and Fastlane for store deployments. Combine them for production-grade DevOps automation.
