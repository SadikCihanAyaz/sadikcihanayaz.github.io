## Data flow props state unidirectional updates

React Native enforces a one-way data flow from parent to child  
State lives in owner component and is passed down as props  
Updates happen via callbacks provided by parent  

### Props

Props are read-only values passed from parent  
Child cannot modify props directly  

```typescript
import React from react-native
import { View Text TouchableOpacity } from react-native

interface DisplayProps {
  count number
  onIncrease ()=>void
}

function DisplayComponent(props DisplayProps) {
  const { count onIncrease } = props

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Count number {count}</Text>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={onIncrease}>
        <Text>Increment</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </>
  )
}
```

### State

State is local to a component and managed via useState  
State change triggers re-render  

```typescript
import React { useState } from react-native
import { View } from react-native

function CounterParent() {
  const [count setCount] = useState(0)

  function increase() {
    setCount(prev => prev + 1)
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <DisplayComponent count={count} onIncrease={increase} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

### Unidirectional updates

Parent holds state and passes down values and callbacks  
Child invokes callback to request update  
State flows down again as new props  

Benefits  
- Predictable flow makes debugging easier  
- Components stay pure when they only use props  

Drawbacks  
- Can add boilerplate for deeply nested callbacks  
- May need context or state library for global data  

Use this pattern to keep UI in sync and maintain single source of truth
