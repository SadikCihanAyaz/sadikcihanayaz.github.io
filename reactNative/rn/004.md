# Hoisting in React Native TypeScript

Hoisting is JavaScript runtime behavior that moves declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. Understanding hoisting helps avoid unexpected bugs in React Native TypeScript projects.

**Key Points**  
- Variable and function declarations are processed before any code runs  
- Only declarations are hoisted not initializations  
- var declarations hoist to function scope let and const hoist to block scope but are uninitialized until their line  
- Function declarations hoist entire definition function expressions do not  

**Why It Matters in React Native**  
In a React Native TypeScript app unexpected undefined values can cause UI errors or crashes. Properly ordering declarations and initializations prevents runtime issues on mobile devices.

**Example 1 Block vs Function Scope**  
Using var leads to undefined rather than a ReferenceError  

```javascript  
function TestHoist() {  
  console.log(value) // logs undefined not error  
  var value = 42  
  console.log(value) // logs 42  
}  

function TestLet() {  
  console.log(count) // throws ReferenceError  
  let count = 10  
}  
```

**Example 2 Component Scope**  
In a React Native component hoisting can impact hook usage  

```javascript  
import React useEffect useState from react-native  

function MyComponent() {  
  console.log(message) // logs undefined  
  var message = textState  

  const [textState setTextState] = useState(Hello)  

  useEffect(() => {  
    console.log(message) // now holds initial textState  
  }, [])  

  return null  
}  
```

Switching var to let or const ensures message is not accessed before initialization  

**Best Practices**  
- Always use let or const for variables  
- Declare hooks and state at top of component  
- Avoid var entirely in TypeScript React Native code  
- Group related declarations together before logic  

**Benefits**  
- Prevents undefined values at runtime  
- Clearer code flow and scoping  
- Leverages TypeScript compile-time checks  

**Negatives of var & Hoisting Pitfalls**  
- var allows redeclaration and leaks outside block  
- Unexpected undefined values hard to debug on device  
- Hoisting surprises can break initial UI render  

Understanding hoisting ensures reliable predictable behavior in your React Native TypeScript apps
