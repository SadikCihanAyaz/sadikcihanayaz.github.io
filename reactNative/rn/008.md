# Event Loop & Concurrency in React Native: Microtasks, Macrotasks, and the JS UI Thread

Understanding the event loop, task queues, and thread behavior is essential for creating responsive React Native applications. Poor async handling can lead to blocked UIs, unresponsive gestures, or dropped frames.

This article breaks down the JavaScript concurrency model, differences between microtasks and macrotasks, and how the JS thread interacts with the UI thread in React Native using TypeScript examples.

## 🔁 What Is the Event Loop?

JavaScript runs on a single thread, and the **event loop** is a mechanism that lets the language handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main execution.

In React Native:

- JavaScript executes on the **JS thread**.
- UI rendering and gestures occur on the **UI thread**.
- Native modules (like networking or file system) operate on **background threads** and communicate via a bridge or JSI.

## ⏱ Microtasks vs. Macrotasks

### Microtasks

- Promise callbacks (`then`, `catch`, `finally`)
- `queueMicrotask`
- Run **immediately after** the current task finishes and **before** the next macrotask

### Macrotasks

- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
- `setImmediate` (Node.js/React Native)
- UI or I/O events
- Run in the **next tick** of the event loop

### Execution Order Example

```js
console.log('A');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('B');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('C');
});

console.log('D');
```

**Output**:
A  
D  
C  
B

## 🧵 React Native Thread Architecture

| Thread        | Purpose                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| JS Thread     | Business logic, rendering logic, state    |
| UI Thread     | Layout, animations, gesture response      |
| Native Modules| Background tasks like networking, storage |

Blocking the **JS thread** prevents UI updates, navigation, and user interactions.

---

## 🛑 Blocking the JS Thread (What Not to Do)

Long synchronous operations freeze the event loop.

### Example: Bad - Blocking Loop

```js
const blockUI = () : void => {
  const start = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - start < 3000) {
    // Busy wait
  }
  console.log('Finished heavy blocking task');
};
```

The UI will be frozen for 3 seconds. This is bad practice.

## ✅ Using Async Patterns to Avoid Freezes

Use `setTimeout`, `requestIdleCallback`, or libraries like `react-native-threads` to defer expensive work.

### Example: Breaking Work into Chunks

```js
const processInChunks = (items: number[]) : void => {
  const chunkSize = 100;

  const processChunk = (start: number) : void => {
    const end = Math.min(start + chunkSize, items.length);
    for (let i = start; i < end; i++) {
      // Simulate work
    }

    if (end < items.length) {
      setTimeout(() => processChunk(end), 0);
    }
  };

  processChunk(0);
};
```

This defers each chunk to the next event loop tick, avoiding UI blocking.

## 🧠 Execution Priority Recap

| Task Type     | Runs After...                   | Example                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Microtask     | Current JS execution             | `Promise.then()`                 |
| Macrotask     | All microtasks in current tick   | `setTimeout()`, `setImmediate()` |
| Blocking code | Immediately                      | Long loops, sync file access     |

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Use `async/await` instead of deeply nested Promises
- Don’t block the event loop with synchronous loops
- Defer background tasks to macrotasks with `setTimeout`
- Offload CPU-intensive work to native modules or background threads

---

## 🧪 Debugging Tools

- Use Flipper’s performance plugin
- Profile with Chrome Debugger or Hermes Inspector
- Watch for dropped frames and long tasks in the JS thread

---

## Conclusion

React Native runs JavaScript on a single thread. Understanding how the **event loop**, **microtasks**, and **macrotasks** work—and how the JS thread interacts with the **UI thread**—is critical for building performant apps. Avoid blocking operations, embrace async patterns, and keep the main thread responsive for a smooth user experience.
