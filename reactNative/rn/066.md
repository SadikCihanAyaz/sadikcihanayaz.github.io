# Push Notifications in React Native: FCM, APNs, Notifee, and `react-native-push-notification`

Push notifications are essential for engaging users, delivering timely updates, and driving retention in mobile applications. In React Native, push functionality involves native integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for iOS. Libraries like **Notifee** and **react-native-push-notification** help manage local and remote notifications with customization options.

This article explains how to set up push notifications in React Native using TypeScript, including how to work with FCM, APNs, and key libraries.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) ‚Äì Android

### What is FCM?

FCM is Google's push notification service that allows you to send messages to Android (and optionally iOS) devices from a backend server or Firebase console.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install dependencies

Use `@react-native-firebase/messaging` for FCM support:

```bash
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/messaging
npx pod-install
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure Android (android/app/)

1. Add `google-services.json` from Firebase Console to `android/app/`
2. Update `build.gradle` files as per Firebase documentation
3. Enable permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Request permissions and get FCM token

```tsx
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging' ;

const requestUserPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission() ;
  const enabled =
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ||
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL ;

  if ( enabled ) {
    const fcmToken = await messaging().getToken() ;
    console.log( 'FCM Token:', fcmToken ) ;
  }
} ;
```

## üçé Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) ‚Äì iOS

### What is APNs?

APNs is Apple‚Äôs native push notification service for iOS devices. It requires:

- An Apple Developer account
- A valid push certificate or key
- A configured App ID with push capabilities

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Enable push in Xcode

- Go to `Signing & Capabilities`
- Add **Push Notifications** and **Background Modes**
- Enable `Remote notifications`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure Firebase for iOS

- Upload your `.p8` key to the Firebase console (Project settings > Cloud Messaging)
- Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your Xcode project

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Handle APNs in app

APNs tokens are automatically linked to FCM if using `@react-native-firebase/messaging`.

---

## üîî Displaying Notifications: Notifee

### What is Notifee?

**Notifee** is a powerful library for managing local and remote notifications. It supports:

- Custom channels and categories
- Advanced notification styling
- Scheduled and recurring notifications
- Works well with FCM

---

### ‚úÖ Install Notifee

```bash
npm install @notifee/react-native
npx pod-install
```

---

### ‚úÖ Create a notification channel (Android)

```tsx
import notifee , { AndroidImportance } from '@notifee/react-native' ;

await notifee.createChannel({
  id : 'default' ,
  name : 'Default Channel' ,
  importance : AndroidImportance.HIGH
}) ;
```

---

### ‚úÖ Display a local notification

```tsx
await notifee.displayNotification({
  title : 'Workout Reminder' ,
  body : 'Time for your evening cardio!' ,
  android : {
    channelId : 'default'
  }
}) ;
```

---

## üì¶ Alternative: `react-native-push-notification`

This older library also supports local and remote notifications and has built-in support for scheduling and handling actions.

---

### ‚úÖ Install and setup

```bash
npm install react-native-push-notification
npx pod-install
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Local notification

```tsx
import PushNotification from 'react-native-push-notification' ;

PushNotification.localNotification({
  title : 'New Message' ,
  message : 'You have received a new chat message.' ,
}) ;
```

> For FCM support, you‚Äôll still need to configure Firebase separately.

---

## üéØ Best Practices

- Always ask for permission **before** sending notifications
- Use channels (Android) and categories (iOS) for granular control
- Respect user privacy ‚Äî allow opt-out
- Use rich notifications (images, buttons) for better engagement
- Handle notification taps (`onNotificationOpenedApp`) to deep link into app

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Push notifications are a core feature of mobile apps. For most apps, combining **FCM + Notifee** provides modern, customizable, and cross-platform support. APNs remains necessary for iOS and is seamlessly integrated via Firebase.

Choose the right tools based on your needs ‚Äî local vs remote, styling vs simplicity ‚Äî and always ensure your users are in control of their notification preferences.
