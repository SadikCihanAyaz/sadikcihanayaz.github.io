# Interview Questions: JavaScript Execution Order, Event Loop, and Task Queues

This section focuses on understanding how JavaScript schedules and executes different types of tasks using the event loop, particularly the concepts of synchronous execution, microtasks, macrotasks, and ticks.

## Question 1: What is the execution order of tasks in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
JavaScript executes code in the following order:

1. **Synchronous code** — runs immediately, top to bottom.
2. **Microtasks** — run after synchronous code finishes, but before moving to the next tick.
3. **Macrotasks** — run after all microtasks are finished, starting in the next event loop tick.

## Question 2: What is a "tick" in the JavaScript event loop?

**Answer:**  
A **tick** is a single cycle of the JavaScript event loop. Each tick includes:

- Running the current synchronous code
- Running all queued microtasks (like `Promise.then()`)
- Then starting the next tick with a macrotask (like `setTimeout()`)

## Question 3: What is the difference between microtasks and macrotasks?

**Answer:**

| Feature         | Microtask                                 | Macrotask                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Runs after      | Synchronous execution                      | Microtasks                         |
| Runs within     | Same tick                                  | Next tick                          |
| Examples        | `Promise.then()`, `queueMicrotask()`       | `setTimeout()`, `setImmediate()`   |
| Use case        | High-priority follow-up logic              | Deferred or scheduled operations   |

## Question 4: Can you show an example of microtask vs. macrotask?

**Answer:**

```tsx
console.log('1');

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('2 (microtask)');
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('3 (macrotask)');
}, 0);

console.log('4');
```

**Output:**

1
4
2 (microtask)
3 (macrotask)

Explanation:
- '1' and '4' are synchronous and run first.
- '2' is a microtask, runs after the sync code in the same tick.
- '3' is a macrotask, runs in the next tick.

## Question 5: Why are microtasks prioritized over macrotasks?

**Answer:**  
Microtasks represent high-priority follow-ups to what just happened in the synchronous phase — e.g., a `.then()` after a resolved `Promise`. They are intended to be quick and essential operations, so the event loop finishes them before allowing new macrotasks to run.

---

## Question 6: What happens if a microtask queues another microtask?

**Answer:**  
The newly added microtask is placed at the end of the current microtask queue and will still run within the same tick — before the event loop moves to the next macrotask.

This means microtasks can continue queuing other microtasks and delay the start of the next tick, potentially causing performance issues if not controlled.

---

## Question 7: How does this apply to React Native?

**Answer:**  
React Native uses a JavaScript engine (Hermes or JSC) that runs JavaScript with the same event loop behavior:

- `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and `requestAnimationFrame` are macrotasks.
- `Promise.then()` and `async/await` use microtasks.
- Native module calls (like fetching data or accessing the camera) are executed on the native thread and communicate back via task queues.
- The Metro bundler compiles your code into a single JavaScript bundle where this task execution model is preserved.

---

## Summary

- JavaScript task scheduling follows this order: sync code → microtasks → macrotasks.
- A **tick** represents one pass through sync + microtask queues.
- Microtasks are always executed before moving on to any macrotask in the next tick.
- Understanding the event loop and task prioritization is essential to writing non-blocking, responsive code, especially in mobile environments like React Native.
